Jack - A Compiler for the OOP language Jack written in C++

<br>

To compile the source code, run build.sh

Then run jc.sh and supply with an argument (Either a .jack file or a directory)

The Pong directory has a sample Jack program in it.

To compile the Jack program inside the Pong directory on your shell, you can write:

./jc.sh Pong

This will create an executable file ready to run.

Enjoy!
